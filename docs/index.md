# Overview

## What is Lightflus?

- Lightflus is a *Cloud-Native Dataflow* framework designed for a common purpose;
- You can be free to maintain a complicated dataflow system with Lightflus. Empower your business with a faster and
  resilient data infra;
- Lightflus can be integrated with mainstream cloud vendor (AWS, GCP, Azure) very easy;

## Features of Lightflus

  as you need.
    - *Small instance*: for small throughput scenery, below 1 thousand elements/s;
    - *Medium instance*: for medium throughput scenery, about 1 thousands elements/s to 5 thousands elements/s;
    - *Large instance*: for large throughput scenery, higher than 5 thousand elements/s;
- *Fault-Tolerance* (In next version): weâ€™re working on this important feature and will release it in next version. We
  use Checkpoint to implement Fault-Tolerance which can promote the scalability and make sure *exactly-once* schema;
- *Implemented by Rust*: Rust is a new programming language which keep good balance between memory security and
  performance. Thanks to Rust, we build Lightflus as a robust and high performance system.
- *Powered by Deno*: Deno is a Javascript runtime co-created by *Ryan Dahl* (He also creates Node.JS). We use Deno as an
  embedded runtime for UDF Operator.
- *Source(Sink) Connector*: We will support more Source (Sink) Connectors in the future. Even more, we can let users

## Why You Should Try Lightflus?

1. ***Cloud-Native***: Lightflus is born for cloud. It's much more agile than Flink. Your team can manage streaming data
   and
   integrate with existing infrastructure more efficient;
2. ***Lower Cost***: Mainstream streaming framework link Flink, Storm, their API is written by Java and the runtime is
   sophisticated. You need to recruit a professional team to handle this. The price is very high (time-consuming,
   cost-expensive and management-risky). Lightflus can offer both big companies and small teams a resilient streaming
   data framework to help them only focus on the core business. **Anyone in your current tech team can be a dataflow
   engineer**.
3. ***Customer Support***: Most streaming framework is an open source. This means Community is the only place you can
   ask for help. As a commercial company, we provide customer support for each enterprise user. You can solve your
   problems much quicker.
4. ***Easy On-boarding***: All-in-one product, you can quickly set up a Lightflus environment by typing several commands
   in the terminal or your Slack's channel and deploy your application on remote cluster locally.
